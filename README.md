Please follow the installation steps in the README file.

# Requirements for Vue Storefront

After making sure that the abovementioned requirements are met, please follow the next steps to integrate this module to Vue Storefront.

Clone this git repository from within your vue-storefront root folder

```shell
git clone git@github.com:MultiSafepay/vsf-payment-multisafepay.git src/modules/vsf-payment-multisafepay
```

# Module registration

Open `src/modules/client.ts`

Add:

```ts
...
import { MultiSafePayPaymentModule } from './vsf-payment-multisafepay'
```

And make sure to also register the module in registerClientModules

```js
registerModule(MultiSafePayPaymentModule);
```

# Add configuration settings

"endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/ext/vsf-multisafepay-service-api"
},
```

Make sure to set the correct location to your API and the routes to the CMS pages in case of an error or an invalid payment status check.

# Integration to theme

We used the default theme, below we'll sum up the changes that are necessary to completely integrate this module to your own theme if you're not using Vue Storefront default theme. We create a isolate components for separate the logic from VSF core but it's necessary to make a few small changes on the core as well.

- Copy and paste the checkout page as we change one v-show condition of thank you page to v-if

```html
<thank-you-page v-if="isThankYouPage" />
```

- As we redirect to MultiSafepay gateweay after placed the order VSF show the default ThankYouPage so we have to add here a notification on the created method. You can copy and paste the file.

```js
created(){
    this.$bus.$emit('notification-progress-start', [this.$t('Redirecting to MultiSafepay'), '...'].join(''))
  },
```

- Add PaymentMethods component into Payment checkout component to display Multisafepay payment methods, you can do with two differents approaches:

1ยบ You can copy/paste the Payment component from this module to your default theme

Or

2ยบ The first one is removing the following code on Payment componet (core/blocks/Checkout/Payment.vue):

```html
<div v-for="(method, index) in paymentMethods" :key="index" class="col-md-6">
	<label class="radioStyled">
		{{ method.title ? method.title : method.name }}
		<input
			type="radio"
			:value="method.code"
			name="payment-method"
			v-model="payment.paymentMethod"
			@change="$v.payment.paymentMethod.$touch(); changePaymentMethod();"
		/>
		<span class="checkmark" />
	</label>
</div>
```

And adding this one:

```html
<payment-methods
	:payment-methods="this.paymentMethods"
	:payment="this.payment"
	:validate="$v.payment"
	:change-payment-method="changePaymentMethod"
></payment-methods>
```

Remember also to import the component and add it on component section:

```js
import PaymentMethods from "src/modules/vsf-payment-multisafepay/components/PaymentMethods";
```

# Manage payment methods

To enable payment methods in your Vue Storefront checkout you have to follow these steps:

1. Enable the payment method in your MultiSafepay Control
2. Enable the payment method in the MultiSafepay Payments for Magento 2 module in your Magento 2 backend system
3. Add the payment methods to the payment_methods_mapping property in the order property config.

Here is a example:

```json
...
"orders": {
    "payment_methods_mapping": {
      "MAESTRO": "maestro",
      "BANKTRANS": "banktrans",
      "DIRECTBANK": "directbank",
      "GIROPAY": "giropay",
      "MISTERCASH": "mistercash",
      "EPS": "eps",
      "IDEAL": "ideal",
      "TRUSTLY": "trustly",
      "MASTERCARD": "mastercard",
      "VISA": "visa"
    },
}

```

To display the images of each payment methods you have to below payment_methods_mapping the mapping for images, just copy and paste the following code:

```json
    "payment_methods_mapping_img": {
      "MAESTRO": "maestro",
      "BANKTRANS": "banktransfer",
      "DIRECTBANK": "sofortbank",
      "GIROPAY": "giropay",
      "MISTERCASH": "mistercash",
      "EPS": "eps",
      "IDEAL": "ideal",
      "TRUSTLY": "trustly",
      "MASTERCARD": "master",
      "VISA": "visa"
    },
```
